# Image-Classification-Templates

This repository contains 2 templates for training images from 2 methods in PyTorch

1. Transfer Learning Classification
2. Custom Model Classification 

# Papers I have read to make these templates
A list of interesting blogs/papers I have read about various deep-learning methods/architectures!
